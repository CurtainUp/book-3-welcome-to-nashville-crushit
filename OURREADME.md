WELCOME TO THE BEST WEB APP EVER v1.0!

Setting up your app shell:
1. In the terminal, go to the lib folder (/lib) and run "npm install"
2. Create your own API folder (/api)
3. Create api/database.json file with the following: 
{
  "my_itinerary": [
    {
      "music": "",
      "park": "",
      "meetup": "",
      "food": "",
      "id": 1,
      "meetup_url": "",
      "name": ""
    }]
}
VOILA! YOU'RE CRUSHING IT.

Note that all saved itineraries will remain in your local database.json.
